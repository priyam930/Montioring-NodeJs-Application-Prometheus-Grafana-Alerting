ðŸš€ **Project: Grafana Dashboard for Node.js Metrics**  

I just set up a **Grafana dashboard** to visualize real-time metrics collected from a Node.js application using **Prometheus**.  

This project demonstrates how to monitor key application performance indicators like:  
âœ… CPU Usage  
âœ… Memory Usage  
âœ… Active Users  
âœ… HTTP Requests  

ðŸ“Œ **Highlights:**  
- Configured Prometheus as a data source in Grafana  
- Created panels to track system metrics and custom application metrics  
- Used provisioning files (`datasources.yaml` & `dashboards.yaml`) to auto-load dashboards  
- Dashboard JSON is reusable for other projects  

ðŸ’¡ **Learning Outcome:**  
Monitoring and visualization are crucial for maintaining application performance and reliability. Grafana + Prometheus provides a powerful combination for observing system and application metrics in real-time.  

ðŸ”— **Folder Structure for Project:**  
```

â”œâ”€â”€ README.txt
â”œâ”€â”€ datasources.yaml
â”œâ”€â”€ dashboards.yaml
â””â”€â”€ dashboard.json
```

This setup can be extended to monitor multiple microservices, integrate alerts, and provide actionable insights for DevOps teams.
